## Notes of folder structure
These are the folders you can see when you look at the project through __finder__.

	-	all
	-	deps
		-	include
		-	lib
	-	experiments
	-	external_src
	-	include
	-	packages
	-	src
	
Here is the explanation:

__all__, contains a simple target that has all other important targets as prerequisites and hence building 'all' builds all the targets of usual interest 

__deps__, contains the public __include__ and __lib__ for external C++ and C libraries that are (or a version is) specific to this project. IN this case __boost__.

__experiments__, a series of targets that build executables that I have used for experiments of component testing.

__external_src__, source files that come from various repos that I have found convenient to use.

__include__, contains the `.h`, `.hpp`, `.ipp` and perhaps some `.cpp` files for this project that are either standalione header files (that do not have a matching `.cpp` file), or define a template class. Note `.ipp` files are the implementation parts of templates and hence are like `.cpp` but must be included inside their corresponding `.hpp`.

__packages__, this is a folder where the `makefile` clones git repos that are used as external components in this project. Once `cloned` into this folder the necessary source files are copied (by the makefile) into __external_src__.
